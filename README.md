# Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Excel

Although Alex, the analyst, led the project. But I make an effort to accomplish it on my own.
I analyzed a real-world dataset on bike sales and created an Excel dashboard to present the results. This project involved data processing, visualization, and insights generation to provide a comprehensive view of bike sales trends and performance. The Excel dashboard offers a user-friendly interface to explore and understand the data, making it a valuable tool for decision-makers and stakeholders in the bike sales industry.
